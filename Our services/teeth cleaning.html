    <h1 class="heading">Teeth Cleaning</h1>
    <p class="font">Teeth cleaning is part of oral hygiene and involves the removal of dental plaque from teeth with the intention of preventing cavities (dental caries), gingivitis, and periodontal disease. People routinely clean their own teeth by brushing and interdental cleaning, and dental hygienists can remove hardened deposits (tartar) not removed by routine cleaning. Those with dentures and natural teeth may supplement their cleaning with a denture cleaner.</p>

   <h2 class="heading1">Brushing</h2>
   <p  class="font">Careful and frequent brushing with a toothbrush helps to prevent build-up of plaque bacteria on the teeth.Electric toothbrushes were developed, and initially recommended for people with strength or dexterity problems in their hands, but they have come into widespread general use. The effectiveness of electric toothbrushes at reducing plaque formation and gingivitis is superior to conventional manual toothbrushes. </p>
    <h2 class="secondary">How to Brush</h2>
  <p class="steps"> Ensuring effective brushing is important in getting rid of food and bacteria properly.

<li class="list"> Place a pea sized amount of toothpaste on the brush and hold at a 45 degree angle.</li>

<li class="list">  In small circular and back and forth motions, move the brush gently along teeth and gums.</li>

<li class="list">  Brush all surfaces inside the mouth, including the tongue.</li></p>

    <h2 class="heading1">Professional teeth cleaning</h2>
<p  class="font">Teeth cleaning (also known as prophylaxis, literally a preventive treatment of a disease) is a procedure for the removal of tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing, especially in areas that are difficult to reach in routine toothbrushing. It is often done by a dental hygienist. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, tooth polishing, and debridement if too much tartar has accumulated. This involves the use of various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from the teeth. The American Dental Association has designated the code D1110 for adult prophylaxis or dental cleaning and has also designated the code D1120 for the same procedure in children.</p>

    <h2 class="heading1">Contents</h2>
  <p  class="font">The space inside the root canals is filled with a highly vascularized, loose connective tissue, called dental pulp. The dental pulp is the tissue of which the dentin portion of the tooth is composed. The dental pulp helps complete formation of the secondary teeth (adult teeth) one to two years after eruption into the mouth. The dental pulp also nourishes and hydrates the tooth structure, making the tooth more resilient, less brittle and less prone to fracture from chewing hard foods. Additionally, the dental pulp provides a hot and cold sensory function.</p>

<div class="five">
    <h2 class="heading1">Variation</h2>
    <p  class="font">Root canals presenting an oval cross-section are found in 50â€“70% of root canals. In addition, canals with a "tear-shaped" cross section are common when a single root contains two canals (as occurs, for example, with the additional mesial root seen with the lower molars), subtleties that can be more difficult to appreciate on classical radiographs.

        Recent studies have shown that use of cone-down CT scans can detect accessory canals that would have been missed in 23% of cases, which can in turn lead to apical periodontitis. The upper molars, in particular, are predisposed to have an occult accessory canal in nearly half of patients</p>
