    <h1 class="heading">Pulp (tooth)</h1>
    <p class="font">The pulp is the connective tissue, nerves, blood vessels, and odontoblasts that comprise the innermost layer of a tooth.The pulp's activity and signalling processes regulate its behaviour.</p>

</div>

<div class="two">
   <h2 class="heading1">Anatomy</h2>
   <p  class="font">The pulp is the neurovascular bundle central to each tooth, permanent or primary. It is composed of a central pulp chamber, pulp horns, and radicular canals. The large mass of the pulp is contained within the pulp chamber, which is contained in and mimics the overall shape of the crown of the tooth.Because of the continuous deposition of the dentine, the pulp chamber becomes smaller with the age. This is not uniform throughout the coronal pulp but progresses faster on the floor than on the roof or sidewalls. </p>
    <!-- <h2 class="secondary">How to Brush</h2> -->
  <p class="steps"> Radicular pulp canals extend down from the cervical region of the crown to the root apex. They are not always straight but vary in shape, size, and number. They are continuous with the periapical tissues through the apical foramen or foramina.</p>

<div class="three">
    <h2 class="heading1">Internal structure</h2>
<p  class="font">The central region of the coronal and radicular pulp contains large nerve trunks and blood vessels.

    This area is lined peripherally by a specialized odontogenic area which has four layers (from innermost to outermost):
<li class="list">Pulpal core, which is in the center of the pulp chamber, with many cells and an extensive vascular supply; except for its location, it is very similar to the cell-rich zone.</li>
<li class="list">Cell-rich zone, which contains fibroblasts and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells.</li>
<li class="list">Cell-free zone (zone of Weil, which is rich in both capillaries and nerve networks.</li>
<li class="list">Odontoblastic layer, the outermost layer which contains odontoblasts and lies next to the predentin and mature dentin.</li>
<p class="snd">Cells found in the dental pulp include fibroblasts (the principal cell), odontoblasts, defence cells like histiocytes, macrophages, granulocytes, mast cells, and plasma cells. The nerve plexus of Raschkow is located central to the cell-rich zone.</p> 
</p>
</div>
<!-- <div class="four">
    <h2 class="heading1">Contents</h2>
  <p  class="font">The space inside the root canals is filled with a highly vascularized, loose connective tissue, called dental pulp. The dental pulp is the tissue of which the dentin portion of the tooth is composed. The dental pulp helps complete formation of the secondary teeth (adult teeth) one to two years after eruption into the mouth. The dental pulp also nourishes and hydrates the tooth structure, making the tooth more resilient, less brittle and less prone to fracture from chewing hard foods. Additionally, the dental pulp provides a hot and cold sensory function.</p>
</div>
<div class="five">
    <h2 class="heading1">Variation</h2>
    <p  class="font">Root canals presenting an oval cross-section are found in 50â€“70% of root canals. In addition, canals with a "tear-shaped" cross section are common when a single root contains two canals (as occurs, for example, with the additional mesial root seen with the lower molars), subtleties that can be more difficult to appreciate on classical radiographs.

        Recent studies have shown that use of cone-down CT scans can detect accessory canals that would have been missed in 23% of cases, which can in turn lead to apical periodontitis. The upper molars, in particular, are predisposed to have an occult accessory canal in nearly half of patients</p>
